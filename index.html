    <h2>Motivating a Secure Web</h2>

    <p>
        Over the last 25 years, the Web has grown into a platform for much of the world’s
        communication, whether it be information sharing, community building, commerce, education,
        social networking, or underpinning applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        In meeting these needs, the Web’s trustworthiness has become critical to its success. If a
        person cannot trust that they are communicating with the party they intend, they can’t use
        the Web to shop safety; if they cannot be assured that Web-delivered news isn’t modified in
        transit, they won’t trust it as much. If someone cannot be assured that they’re talking
        only to the intended recipients, they might avoid social networking.
    </p>
    <p>
        These important properties of authentication, integrity and confidentiality are best — if
        imperfectly — provided on the Web by Transport Layer Security (TLS) [[RFC5246]]. For the
        HTTP protocol, this means using "https://" URLs [[RFC7230]].
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past, Web sites have deployed HTTPS rarely; often, only when financial transactions
        take place. More recently, however, it has become apparent that nearly all activity on the
        Web can be considered sensitive, since it now plays such a central role in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, security on the Web has proven to be quite subtle. If an attacker can
        modify content in transit, the power of the Web platform we are defining can easily be
        turned against the user (or the site they are using).
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, networks can (and some do) insert advertisements into unencrypted Web pages;
        by nature, this conveys the ability to track users. Even more hostile attacks include
        inserting persistent code into the browser that is run on subsequent visits ("cache
        poisoning"), or changing content (such as editing a company's Web site to affect its stock
        price). Notably, these risks are just as present for users of "plain" Web sites as they are
        for those using more sophisticated, interactive sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, if confidentiality is lost, something as simple as an image request "in the clear"
        (i.e., unencrypted) can give an attacker information about what the user is doing, opening
        an opportunity for further attacks -- again, even if the content being accessed seems
        innocuous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, widespread attacks like Pervasive Monitoring [[RFC7258]] further erode users' trust
        in the Web -- whether they be activists, businesses or ordinary citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        This leads us to a conclusion that server authentication and integrity are baseline
        requirements for the continued success of the Web. Furthermore, confidentiality -- while
        not always strictly necessary -- is often a desirable property, and it is difficult to
        predict or know when it is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the TAG finds that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Web platform should be designed to <strong>actively prefer secure
      communication</strong> — typically, by encouraging use of "https://" URLs instead of
      "http://" ones (although exceptions like "localhost" do exist).</li>
      <li><strong>Barriers to adopting "https://" should be removed</strong> where feasible.</li>
      <li>The <strong>end-to-end nature of TLS encryption must not be compromised</strong> on the
      Web, in order to preserve trust.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2 id="implementation">Building A Secure Web with W3C Standards</h2>

    <p>
        Within the W3C, there are a number of potential areas to both mitigate issues encountered
        in transitioning to and using encryption, as well as ways to encourage its use. This
        includes (but is not limited to):
    </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Evaluating "Powerful" Features</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Many new Web platform features offer increased capabilities, access to data and richer
        functionality. Some of these "powerful" features also have significant security and privacy
        implications, and Working Groups should consider whether they ought only be used over an
        encrypted connection. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Applications
        Security Working Group</a> (WebAppSec) has begun work on [[powerful-features]] to document
        best practices in this area.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>Controlling Scheme-dependent Behaviors</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Existing specifications that change behavior based upon the URL scheme ("http://" vs.
        "https://") should be examined to see if these differences can either be eliminated or
        controlled by authors, provided that there is no loss of security or surprising changes in
        behavior. For example, the [[referrer-policy]] specification is offering more control over
        the Referer HTTP header, as part of [[CSP2]].
    </p></dd>

    <dt>Managing Changing Links</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Updating sites from "http://" to "https://" necessitates changing links to resources, which
        is counter to the good practice of "avoiding URI aliases" [[webarch]]. To mitigate such
        changes, Working Groups (in particular, those dealing with Linked Data) should consider how
        redirects (like 301 Moved Permanently) and Strict Transport Security [[RFC6769]] can be
        used to assert that a "http://" origin has been replaced by an "https://" one.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>Transitioning Mashups</dt>
    <dd><p>
        When transitioning from "http://" to "https://", applications that depend upon third-party
        resources ("mashups") that have not yet changed to "https://" themselves can experience
        difficulties, because of the Mixed Content policy [[mixed-content]]. We encourage WebAppSec
        to examine this problem.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>Facilitating Shared Caching</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Adopting "https://" has the side effect of disallowing shared HTTP caching [[RFC7234]].
        Shared caching has a limited role on the Web today; many high traffic sites either
        discourage caching with metadata, or disallow it by already using "https://". However,
        shared caching is still considered desirable by some (e.g., in limited networks); in some
        cases, it might be so desirable that networks require users to accept TLS Man-in-the-Middle
        -- which is a bad outcome for Web security overall. Therefore, we encourage exploration of
        alternative mechanisms that preserve security more robustly, such as certain uses of
        Subresource Integrity [[SRI]].
    </p></dd>

    <dt>Browser Policy Extension APIs</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Similarly, adopting "https://" makes the practice of imposing policy in intermediaries
        (e.g., in schools and workplaces, by parents, in prisons) more difficult. While TLS
        Man-in-the-Middle is one solution to this, it is a blunt one, sacrificing substantial
        security when they are used. Therefore, we encourage development of facilities to enable
        imposition of policy -- when it is necessary -- in a more controlled way, e.g., as new APIs
        for Web browser extensions.
    </p><dd>

    <dt>Documentation of Best Practices</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Changing to "https://" is often difficult, for a variety of reasons. We encourage
        development of documentation to aid Web content creators, administrators and implementers
        in this process. In particular, since W3C has expertise in the implications upon content
        creators, our documentation should focus on this audience.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>User Experience of Security</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Educating and interacting with users regarding security is notoriously difficult. Even so,
        we encourage the implementer community to continuously challenge their assumptions in this
        space; for example, there is currently a discussion changing how "http://" URLs are
        presented so that they are marked insecure, or even defaulting to "https://" when a URL
        reference without a scheme is input. Where appropriate, we also encourage these discussions
        to take place in W3C fora.

  <h2>Work Outside the W3C</h2>

    <p>
        To facilitate this finding, the TAG encourages continuing improvement of both TLS and its
        use in Web protocols, while acknowledging that some of this work may not be best suited for
        the W3C. In particular:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Addressing the financial and administrative costs of TLS are critical to improving
          adoption of encryption. We are encouraged by efforts like <a
          href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
          Deploying HTTPS is problematic in some networks. For example, in small, ad-hoc
          networks (e.g., home networks), it's common to use private network address ranges
          [[RFC1918]] to access things like printers, routers and so on using the bare IP
          address. Because a certificate cannot be obtained for these addresses, and because
          giving globally-unique DNS names to these devices is impractical, anther approach is
          needed.
      </li>
      <li>
          Increasing the trustworthiness of the PKI system (on which HTTPS is currently
          dependent) remains a challenge. We are tracking efforts like <a
          href="http://www.certificate-transparency.org">Certificate Transparency</a>
          [[RFC6962]] in the IETF, and will encourage activity within the W3C when appropriate.
      </li>
      <li>
          Exploring the impact upon trust and security of practices such as so-called "split
          browsers" which automatically proxy and transform traffic (sometimes including
          HTTPS), as well as the continuing practice of inserting new Certificate Authorities
          into a users' trust store without informing them of the power this grants. While both
          have legitimate uses, the implications for trust on the Web should be examined,
          and Web users educated about the trade-offs involved.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="appendix">
    <h2>Other Concerns about HTTPS</h2>

    <p>
        Transitioning Web sites to "https://" URLs often brings up concerns that aren't covered
        in the issues discussed above, including:
    </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>"https://" doesn't address security issues on the server itself</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Encryption will not solve all security problems in the Web platform, both
        because it does not address many types of attack, and because TLS itself has been shown to
        have flaws in the past (and presumably will again). However, it does serve as an important
        and necessary baseline for further improvements to security. This is especially true as the
        platform becomes more powerful, and thus more dangerous to use “in the clear”.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>TLS has too much CPU overhead</dt>
    <dd><p>
        The CPU overhead of TLS has largely been overcome by advances in processor technology;
        modern CPUs are much faster, use less power, and often have specialized chips for
        accelerating cryptography. As a result, many sites report that encryption overhead is
        manageable, or even "in the noise." However, note that some specialized techniques for very
        high performance servers (such as sendfile() and TCP Splice) are unavailable when using TLS.
    </p></dd>

    <dt>"https://" has substantial impact upon perceived performance</dt>
    <dd><p>
        Historically, the perceived performance of HTTPS has been worse than that of cleartext
        HTTP, because of the extra round trips that the handshake and certificate validation
        require. However, recent developments such as OCSP Stapling [[RFC6961]] and TLS session
        tickets [[RFC5077]] have reduced this overhead to the point where the deficit is minor --
        often, imperceptible (see <a href="https://istlsfastyet.com">Is TLS Fast Yet?</a> for
        details). We expect that future developments (such as TLS/1.3) will further reduce the
        performance penalty of encryption.
